# Copperfall - A Creative Code Lab Diary

## 13/01/2025
The first day was the day that I started planning and experiment with how to approach making this game. I already had a way in mind, but unfortunately the method I had in mind has a very similiar process on how I would make a game in a game engine. I tried to make use of the sample code provided by the 2D Browser Game Coding course but it just seems like I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted to.

Today I scrapped my experiments from yesterday and devised my own system, a custom game engine of sorts. One that would work exactly the way I need it to work, one that has only the things I need for this game, and nothing more. I then was able to create a nice structured codebase and implemented a player controller, as well as a component for squashing and stretching, complete with a custom pivoting option. Combining the player controller with the squashing and stretching, having acceleration and deceleration, as well as having a null-cancelling movement system made a character that would feel good to run around with.
